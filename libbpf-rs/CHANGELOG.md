Unreleased
----------
- Added `Program::attach_iter` for attaching of programs to an iterator
- Added `Map::delete_batch` method for bulk deletion of elements
- Improved `btf_type_match!` macro, adding support for most of Rust's `match`
  capabilities
- Fixed issue where instances of `Map` created or opened without going through
  `Object` would leak file descriptors
- Fixed potential Uprobe attachment failures on optimized builds caused by
  improper `libbpf_sys::bpf_object_open_opts` object initialization
- Adjusted various methods to work with `BorrowedFd` instead of raw file
  descriptors
- Made `RingBufferBuilder::add` enforce that `self` cannot outlive the maps
  passed into it
- Adjusted `Error::System` variant textual representation to include `errno`
  string

  accessors
- Added `MapInfo` type as a convenience wrapper around `bpf_map_info`
  - Added `Map::info` to `Map` to make it easier to derive `MapInfo` from a
