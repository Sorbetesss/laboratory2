# This package is a loathsome hack for making contents of the
# unpublished vmlinux.h crate available in a context that is
# conceptually dev-only, but in reality, because of Cargo manifest
# expressiveness limitations, really isn't.
# This package is deliberately not part of any workspace, because it is
# called build from a build.rs script, meaning we are in a recursive
# Cargo invocation. Best to not have any connection to other workspace
# data, in case commong file locks get acquired etc.
